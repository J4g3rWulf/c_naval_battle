# c_naval_battle

A naval battle game made in C with 3 difficulties.

This project actually began when a friend doubted me to do a naval battle game
in C while we were studying it in basic courses such as Data Structure I and II.

After a while, though, I actually grew quite fond of my "First" project and decided
to build on it and develop a barebones, but fully functional, C game of naval battle.

Run it on Dev-C++ or VSCode and enjoy!
